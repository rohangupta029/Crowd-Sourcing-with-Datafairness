# Crowd-Sourcing-with-Datafairness
A research based project worked under Dr Shweta Jain in IIT Ropar 


The internship revolves around a research paper which is based on datafairness. Generally when a task is assigned to crowd workers, they can be discriminatory with respect to some sensitive attribute.  This led to minimize the accuracy of that algorithm. It will be more understandable with an example.
Like a software COMPASS which is used by American court which predict the recidivism risk for a criminal in next two year, but later it found that this software is biased towards White and produced high risk score for Black American
So, I have used machine learning algorithm and Probability Distribution to increase the accuracy of the model for sensitive attributes and compare that attributes with and without biasness.
